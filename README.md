### A quick introduction:

This library is created for the sake of convenience, that's just because I was too frustrated reusing the same project template for the 1 billionth time, and most of the time I make changes to the original GUI wrapper that I also want to replicate to other projects.

Now with Doxygen documentation!

This is useless unless you want to make something in SDL2 (like a game engine or so).

Simple toolkit, provides basic GUI components.
