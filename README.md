### A quick introduction:

This library is created for the sake of convenience, that's just because I was too frustrated reusing the same project template for the 1 billionth time, and most of the time I make changes to the original GUI wrapper that I also want to replicate to other projects.

I wrote the documentation in a way that I feel most comfortable, so I can come back and read later in case I can't understand my code, which was badly written.

This is useless unless you want to make something in SDL2 (like a game engine or so).

Simple toolkit, provides basic GUI components.
